Usage
=====

This page details how to use ``lpath``.  Follow the `Getting Started`_ page to learn how to install ``lpath``.

.. _Getting Started: https://lpath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html


Introduction
------------
``lpath`` is made of three separate steps: ``discretize``, ``extract``, and ``match``. All these steps take a variety of different parameters, which are all listed in the `API`_ page.

1. The ``discretize`` step is used to discretize your trajectories for the purpose of finding successful transitions.
2. The ``extract`` step takes what's assigned in ``discretize`` and identifies all instances where there is a successful transition.
3. The ``match`` step takes what's outputted in ``extract`` and cross pattern match to identify pathway classes. It is possible to reassign states in this step.


There are two different ways of running these steps. Due to the sheer amount of parameter options, it is recommended that users start with the Jupyter notebook.

1. Import each step's ``main()`` function and run everything in an interactive python session (e.g., Jupyter notebook).  **[RECOMMENDED]**
2. Run through the command line (e.g., ``lpath discretize -I west.h5 --assign-arguments '--config-from-file --scheme TEST'``.

Molecular Dynamics
------------------
``lpath`` is written to cluster pathways from molecular dynamics simulation. The input file will be a numpy or text file of the features used to assign states. For example, an alanine dipeptide system will use the phi, psi angles.

Discretize
__________
In this step, we will assign each frame of an MD trajectory based on the phi/psi dihedral angles saved in ``dihedral.npy``.
Here is an example ``assign`` function (in a file called ``module.py``) used for assigning states::

    def assign_dih(input_array):
        """
        This is an example function for mapping a list of features to state IDs. This should be subclassed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_array : numpy.ndarray
            An array generated from load_file.

        Returns
        -------
        state_list : list
            A list containing
        """
        state_list = []
        for val in input_array:
            if val[0] >= -180 and val[0] <= -45 and val[1] >= -55 and val[1] <= 30:  # Phi/Psi for Alpha Helix
                state_list.append(0)
            elif val[0] >= 165 and val[0] <= 180 and val[1] >= -55 and val[1] <= 30:
                state_list.append(0)
            elif val[0] >= -170 and val[0] <= -55 and val[1] >= 40 and val[1] <= 100:  # Phi/Psi for C7eq
                state_list.append(1)
            elif val[0] >= 25 and val[0] <= 90 and val[1] >= -55 and val[1] <= 0:  # Phi/Psi for C7ax
                state_list.append(2)
            else:
                state_list.append(3)

        return state_list


We will monkey-patch this function into ``lpath``.

1. From the command line, run the following::

    lpath discretize -I dihedral.npy -O states.npy -af module.assign_dih --stride 100


2. We've read in ``dihedral.npy`` with a stride step of 100. This smaller dataset will be discretized with module.assign_dih. This will generate a ``states.npy`` file to be used in the ``extract`` step.

Extract
_______
In this step, we will identify any successful transitions in the trajectory. We will be looking at the C7:sub:`eq` to C7:sub:`ax` transition.
Since we already read in the data every 100 frames with ``--stride 100`` in `discretize`, we do not need to use ``--stride`` again. If you want to include in extra features for reassignment later on (i.e. in ``match``), use the ``--feature-stride 100`` option.

1. From the command line, run the following::

    lpath extract --extract-input states.npy --extract-output pathways.pickle --source-state 1 --target-state 2


Match
_____
In this step, we will pattern match any successful transitions we've identified in ``extract``. We will, again, be looking at the C7:sub:`eq` to C7:sub:`ax` transition.

1. From the command line, run the following::

    lpath match --input-pickle succ_traj/pathways.pickle --cluster-labels-output succ_traj/cluster_labels.npy

2. After the comparison process is completed, it should show you the dendrogram. Closing the figure should trigger prompts to guide you further.

3. Input ``y`` if you think the threshold (horizontal line which dictates how many clusters there are) should be a different value. Otherwise, input ``n`` and tell the program how many clusters you want at the end.

Weighted Ensemble Simulations
-----------------------------
``lpath`` is written to cluster pathways generated by the `WESTPA`_ software suite. Make sure `WESTPA`_ is installed. See the `Getting Started`_ page for more information.

.. _WESTPA: https://westpa.github.io/

Discretize
__________
We will use `WESTPA`_'s ``w_assign`` tool to assign to states. See the tool's `wiki`_ page and `Sphinx`_ documentation for more information about the tool.

.. _wiki: https://github.com/westpa/westpa/wiki/man:w_assign
.. _Sphinx: https://westpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/cli/w_assign.html


We'll try to discretize a ``multi.h5`` (generated with ``w_multi_west --ibstates``) with ``w_assign`` based on what's defined with the ``TEST`` scheme in the ``west.cfg``.

1. Run the following in the command line to run ``w_assign``::

    lpath discretize -we -W multi.h5 -A ANALYSIS/TEST/assign.h5 \
        --assign-args "-W multi.h5 -r west.cfg --config-from-file --scheme TEST"


Extract
_______
In this step, we will identify any successful transitions in the trajectory. We will be looking at the C7:sub:`eq` to C7:sub:`ax` transition.
If you are looking to compare using segment IDs in the next step (not recommended for simulations combined with ``w_multi_west``) or want to include the waiting time (time spent in the source state) in the pattern matching, make sure you turn on ``--trace-basis`` to trace all the way back to the basis state. Do note that this significantly increases the time it requires to extract all successful trajectories.

1. From the command line, run the following::

    lpath extract -we -W multi.h5 -A ANALYSIS/TEST/assign.h5 --source-state 1 \
        --target-state 2 --extract-output output.pickle --out-dir succ_traj


Match
_____
In this step, we will pattern match any successful transitions we've identified in ``extract``. We will, again, be looking at the C7:sub:`eq` to C7:sub:`ax` transition.
This will do the pattern matching and output individual h5 files for each cluster.

1. From the command line, run the following::

    lpath match -we --input-pickle succ_traj/output.pickle --cluster-labels-output succ_traj/cluster_labels.npy \
        --export-h5 --file-pattern "west_succ_c{}.h5"

2. After the comparison process is completed, it should show you the dendrogram. Closing the figure should trigger prompts to guide you further.

3. Input ``y`` if you think the threshold (horizontal line which dictates how many clusters there are) should be a different value. Otherwise, input ``n`` and tell the program how many clusters you want at the end.


For cases where you want to run pattern matching comparison between segment IDs, you will have to use the largest common substring ``--substring`` option. By default, the longest common subsequence algorithm is used.::

    lpath match -we --input-pickle succ_traj/output.pickle --cluster-labels-output succ_traj/cluster_labels.npy \
        --export-h5 --file-pattern "west_succ_c{}.h5" --reassign-function "reassign_segid" --substring
